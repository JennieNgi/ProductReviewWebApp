# Product Review Web App
This is a simple web application that allows users to review a product by providing a star rating and a comment. The application displays a single photo of the product and a list of all previous reviews, sorted by the most recent at the top.

## Usage
When you open the web app, you will see a single photo of the product and a list of all previous reviews, if any. To add a new review, click on the "Add a review" checkbox and fill in the form with your rating, first name, last name, and comment. The rating can be set by clicking on the star icons to select the desired rating. The character count for the comment will be displayed below the text area. When you submit the form, the new review will be added to the list, and the form will be hidden.

If you don't fill in the first name or last name fields, the review author will be set to "Anonymous". If you don't fill in the comment field, the review will not be saved.

You can click on the "Back to top" link/button for each review to return to the top of the page.
